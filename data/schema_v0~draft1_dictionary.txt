# Schema for a `fldic` (FlorisBoard dictionary) file

`fldic` is the unified file format for FlorisBoard v0.4+ to store words, ngrams and shortcuts as dictionaries for all
NLP-related text-based functionality, such as predictive input and spell checking.

The file format is based on the Toml file format, however it is important to note that `fldic` files are in no way
compatible with regular Toml files and vice-versa!

This file describes the schema of a fldic (FlorisBoard dictionary) file in a human-readable way. In the current state
of the project there is no machine-readable version of this schema available, however this may change in the future.

## General info

The only supported and allowed character encoding of `fldic` files is UTF-8. Other encodings are either misinterpreted
or rejected, depending on if the encoding specifier was provided or not.

Lines starting with a hashtag symbol (`#`) are interpreted as line comments and are completely ignored, except
if it resembles a global specifier (see below).

## Structure/syntax

This subsection describes the general structure of a `fldic` file. The order of the sections is required to be the same
as stated in this schema, else the deserialization process will not work properly.

### 0. Global specifiers

Each `fldic` file MUST start with a special schema specifier line comment which has the link to the published schema,
else the file cannot be read properly. Additionally, the second line can optionally indicate the encoding of the file,
however this has no effect as of v0~draft1 as only UTF-8 is supported.

Example:

```
#~schema: https://florisboard.org/schemas/fldic/v0~draft1/dictionary.txt
#~encoding: utf-8
```

### 1. Metadata

The first section after the global section must be the `[meta]` section, which provides the necessary metadata for the
dictionary reader. It is written in a Toml-like syntax, however only strings and single-line arrays are supported as of
v0~draft1. See the example for all supported properties and their type:

Example:

```
[meta]
name = "example"
display_name = "Example"
locales = ["en-US"]
generated_by = ["manual_example"]
authors = ["John Doe <john@doe.com>"]
license = "Apache-2.0"
```
